                <span class="overview">This project consisted of a reddit styled social media. It would have several categories, such as "Crypto Currency", "News", "Memes" and more ... Users would be able to access any of those categories, with instantaneous load speeds. Such fast load speeds were possible because of an asynchronous, cache like, backend design. One of the most advanced I've done so far. It had NEXT.js levels of speed, but backend based. It offered me great, real-world code design, with difficult deadlines.</span>

Some design patters were used following Clean Code's guides. Also, had to maintain quality control in check, as well as test rate to at least 80%.</span>

                <span class="overview">To do website and REST API, using React on the frontend and Express on the backend. A big issue while making this project was avoiding race-conditions, but the backend has a really great tutorial on how to do it. The overall note of this project is definitely my highest. Both frontend and backend communicate with each other in realtime. A great feature and one of my favorites is the session handling, making you able to close the website, and it will remember who you are, avoiding the need to login again. All of that was made thinking on security first, but also speed and convenience.</span>

It automatically published a list of products on facebook market place and groups designed to sell. I've also developed a similar algorithm, but for Instagram, where the target was to gain followers to your page. The algorithm did that by following hundreds of users, adding the profile url to a database. And un-following those users after 3 days.</span>
