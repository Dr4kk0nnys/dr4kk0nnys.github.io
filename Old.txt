Hi! I'm Renato, more commonly known as Dr4kk0nnys! I am from Brazil, and speak fluent English since 12. Developing and Design / Drawing are my passion and I really feel like I'm going somewhere with it. I'm not the best, but I'm trying to improve every day.

My background with programming started at a very young age ( I started programming at 11 years old, making Minecraft mods with java. ). The reason I speak English with such ease is because of this early experience.

I currently work with multiple programming languages, such as:
• Java | • Python 3 | • Typescript | • JavaScript | • C#

My goal as a person is to never neglect reason by emotion. To be as fair as possible, and always be ready to change, no matter how hard it is or it will be.
My goal as a software engineer is to always help. Shaping software as a way to reach for others. To create slim and highly-performance code. And to always be dispose to learn more and more.

My hobbies are:
‣ Drawing

‣ Archery
‣ Take care of my plants and animals
‣ Make fancy food

My goals for the next 5 years are:
[ X ] - Invest R$ 50.000
[ X ] - Get a job as a software engineer
[ X ] - Travel alone
[ X ] - Improve my conversation skills with strangers
[ X ] - Build a computer from scratch
