        <span class="introduction">Hi! I'm Renato, more commonly known as Dr4kk0nnys!
             I am from Brazil, and speak fluent English since 12.
             My background with programming started at 11 years old, making Minecraft mods with java.
             After a long path, I've mastered <span class="bold">Java</span>, <span class="bold">Javascript</span>, <span class="bold">Typescript</span>, <span class="bold">Python</span>, and numerous concepts, such as <span class="bold">OOP</span>, <span class="bold">Functional Programming</span>, <span class="bold">Micro contracts</span>, etc ...
             The reason I speak English with such ease is because of this early experience. I'm not the best, but I'm trying to improve every day.
